To setup and run the PHG using the small genome created in this
directory, you need to execute the shell scripts in the order listed below.

The CreateSmallGenomesPlugin class called via the createSmallSeqDS.sh
script uses a docker to create a small data set for testing.  This data
set is created in the /root directory of the docker.  These files are
mounted to the specified place in the user's /workdir.  The scripts have
docker mount points setup that reflect where the data lives for each step. 

createSmallSeqDS.sh mounts a configuration file to a docker directory.
This configuration file is used to decide the size and divergence of the
dataset to be created.  For this example, the gene length, inter-gene length,
and number of genes are set.  In addition, the "refInterGeneDelete" parameter
is set, which is used to create diversity in the genomes.

Once you have successfully run the pipeline with the provided configuration file
you may play with the other available parameters.  These exist in the config
file but are commented out.

If you wish to re-run createSmallSeqDS.sh after the data sets have been
created, either delete or rename your phgSmallSeq folder.  Docker is unable
to delete/overwrite this as it lives in docker in /root.  You will see an error
if you re-run createSmallSeqDS.sh without removing/renaming the old phgSmallSeq
directory.

# NOTE: This is only relevant to the Cornell BioHPC (cbsu).
They have implemented “docker1” which is a more secure docker.  
I’m unsure about the files in the docker /root and
whether they will be deletable.
Before deleting files/directories created on cbsu machines, you must reclaimed
them via the command:

   docker1 claim

1.  Create the data set:
    Edit createSmallSeqDS.sh:
# Edit the code, replacing "/Users/jj332/Documents/PHG/" 
# with your preferred directory (In this and subsequent scripts).
# Note: in some subsequent scripts /temp/ is added to FOLDER
# Then replace "${FOLDER}Scripts/configSmallSeq.txt" with the
# path on your machine that contains the configSmallSeq.txt file

    ./createSmallSeqDS.sh > <outputfile>

2.  Load the reference genome data:
    Edit loadGenomes.sh:

    ./loadGenomes.sh > <outputfile>

3.  Load assembly haplotypes:
    Edit createAssemblyHaplotypes.sh:

    ./createAssemblyHaplotypes.sh > <outputfile>

4.  Create/load the GATK raw haplotypes:
    Edit createHaplotypesAll.sh:

    ./createHaplotypesAll.sh  > <outputfile> 

5.  Create/load consensus data:
    Edit createConsensus.sh:

    ./createConsensus.sh > <outputfile>

6.  Find and export paths through the graph:
    Edit findAndExportPath.sh:

    ./findAndExportPath.sh  > <outputfile>

This short pipeline creates and populates an sqlite database.  The data files
needed for loading the database are created in the first step (createSmallSeqDS.sh)

Starting with loadGenomes.sh, each step above will populate additional data in the
sqlite database.  This database is named "phgSmallSeq.db".  The path to the database is:

      ${FOLDER}/temp/phgSmallSeq/phgSmallSeq.db
