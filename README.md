# PHG
Practical Haplotype Graph
This repository is for documenting the process of creating a Practical Haplotype Graph (PHG) for wheat.
The database and loading scripts are developed by the <a href=https://bitbucket.org/bucklerlab/practicalhaplotypegraph/wiki/Home>Buckler Lab</a>.
The sequencing resources for the Wheat PHG are listed at <a href=https://triticeaetoolbox.org/wheat/phg/>The Triciceae Toolbox</a> (T3/Wheat).

Directory SmallSeqTest_Scripts contains scripts, config file, and instructions for a very small PHG.  It works on Jean-Luc's Mac laptop 06/15/2019
