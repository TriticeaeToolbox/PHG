Creating Reference Ranges for wheat

I used the gVCF files to define the reference ranges. The script reads in a number of gVCF files with the following filters.
QUAL > 30
GQ > 40
GT == "0/0" or "1/1"

I start with a range of 200 bases on each side of the variant 
then merge intervals that overlap or are within 10,000 bases of another interval

Then the position information is converted to part1, part2 because 
some parts of the pipeline can not handle chromosomes greater than 500M base pairs.

The results a written to a file.
